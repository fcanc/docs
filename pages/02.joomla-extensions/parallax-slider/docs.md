##Before you begin
Parallax Slider doesn't work without some content, so the first thing you will need to do is create some articles or K2 items.

If you have a Expert Explorer package that includes Xpert Scroller, you can view the demo content for an example.

You should first create a new category or select one that you wish to display articles from. Then place new articles into it with your content. Make sure to provide intro text and if you wish an image, as these are what is used to display the snippets.

Once you have your selection of content ready, you can then start to work with Parallax Slider.

##Troubleshooting
<em>**Do i need jQuery?**</em>

Yes this module requires it.

<em>**Module not scrolling, why?**</em>

This is possible for a few reasons. If jQuery is already included on your site by the template or another extension, then make sure to disable it in in Parallax Slider. Sometime another extension load jquery, make sure jquery loaded only once in header and top of all script.

<em>**Image not showing, why?**</em>

Make sure your image path is ok and you have no ```/``` beginning of your image path. For K2 article it looks for article image not image from introtext, so make sure you have article image for each article.

<em>**Text not showing, why?**</em>

Make sure you have some text in your article and you've turned on ```show introtext```&nbsp;option form module settings.

<em>**I can't save or apply admin settings, why?**</em>

We recommend to use Firefox 4+/Chrome/Safari/Opera for admin management. It has some problem saving settings from ```Internet Explorer```.

<em>**Why do article open on the same page?**</em>

When your articles or category of these article not assigned on menu item joomla will open article under home menu item. To avoide this you should create a menu item and assing a category for it, then you can hide the menu item.
